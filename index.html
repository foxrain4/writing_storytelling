    From epic RPGs to mysterious visual novels, the greatest games stick with us not just because of gameplay—but because of the <b>story</b>. 
    Think of <i>Chrono Trigger</i>, <i>Undertale</i>, <i>NieR</i>, or the browser-based adventures that sparked your imagination.
    The reason you remember them? <b>Emotion. Meaning. Change.</b>

  <h3 style="color: #51cf66; margin-top: 40px;">🔥 Storytelling Tips from the Field</h3>
  <p>
    These aren’t rules. They’re sparks. Use what fuels you—burn the rest.
  </p>

  <div style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin-top: 20px;">
    <p><b>🎭 Characters First.</b><br>
    The story doesn’t start with a world. It starts with a person who wants something… and what they’re willing to do to get it.</p>

    <p><b>⏳ Pacing is Power.</b><br>
    Slow builds can explode. Fast scenes can feel fragile. Knowing <i>when</i> to reveal changes everything.</p>

    <p><b>🎯 Stakes, not just action.</b><br>
    Why does the battle matter? Why does the journey <i>hurt</i>? The world doesn’t need to end—but something personal might.</p>

    <p><b>🌌 Atmosphere is Storytelling.</b><br>
    Let the <i>tone</i> do the heavy lifting. Rainfall, silence, colors, traditions—these tell us where we are and what kind of tale this is.</p>

    <p><b>🎵 Repetition = Resonance.</b><br>
    Echo phrases. Mirror scenes. Repeat symbols. It makes your story feel <i>inevitable</i>—even on the first read.</p>

    <p><b>🧠 Subvert Yourself.</b><br>
    Don’t try to be “clever.” Be honest. Set things up. Then break your own pattern. That’s when readers lean in.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #339af0; margin-top: 40px;">🧵 Deep Dive: Building the Web</h3>
  <p>
    Great stories are <i>webs</i>—and at the center are characters.
  </p>
  <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
    <li>🧍 Who are they, <i>really</i>?</li>
    <li>🎯 What do they want—and what do they hide from themselves?</li>
    <li>🔗 What connects them to others? (Enemies, lovers, rivals, followers)</li>
    <li>💔 What <i>flaws</i> make them real?</li>
    <li>🔥 What would they <i>never</i> do—until they finally do?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Write the threads, the contradictions, the quiet moments. That’s where the magic lives.
  </p>
